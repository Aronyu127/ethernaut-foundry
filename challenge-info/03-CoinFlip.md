# CoinFlip Challenge

## Ethernaut Description
This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

## Extra Context
Randomness generated on chain is deterministic, this means if someone can mirror your method for creating randomisation then it's not really random at all.
