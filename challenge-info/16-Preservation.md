# Preservation Challenge

## Ethernaut Description


The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you are given.

**Things that might help**

- Look into Solidity's documentation on the delegatecall low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain. libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
- Understanding what it means for delegatecall to be context-preserving.
- Understanding how storage variables are stored and accessed.
- Understanding how casting works between different data types.

## Extra Context
This is another test of your understanding of how delegate call works.
Although it is worth noting that library contracts should not have their own state to avoid issues such as this. However this can be a common occurance when working with proxy implementations.
